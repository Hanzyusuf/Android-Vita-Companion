### Tips

- It is better to assign or reserve an IP for your PS Vita, this will allow you to use the same IP address everytime so you don't have to lookup the IP each time.

- You can also install the [nosleep plugin by NamelessGhoul0](https://github.com/NamelessGhoul0/nosleep) if you don't want your PS Vita to go into standby mode. Without this, once in standby mode, this app won't work until you press the PS Home button on your PS Vita to wake it up.

- It is better to forget all networks on the PS Vita and only connect it to one network so to make it stay consistent with an IP. Your mobile hotspot may be the best option.
